# Early Detection of Lifestyle Diseases Using Generative AI

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for the early detection of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders using Generative AI and machine learning techniques. By leveraging large-scale datasets, including those from Kaggle, the system seeks to improve predictive accuracy and provide personalized healthcare recommendations.

## Objectives
- **Enhance Predictive Accuracy**: Utilize advanced AI techniques to analyze health and lifestyle datasets for accurate disease predictions.
- **Integrate Real-Time Monitoring**: Incorporate data from wearable devices to enable dynamic risk assessments.
- **Address Ethical Concerns**: Develop robust data protection protocols to ensure patient privacy.
- **Promote Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Foster collaboration among healthcare professionals, data scientists, and policymakers for effective implementation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Relevant datasets will be sourced from Kaggle, covering health indicators and lifestyle factors.
2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) will be employed to create synthetic patient data, enhancing the robustness of the training dataset.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models, including Random Forest and Neural Networks, will be trained using the prepared datasets.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The system will monitor vital signs using IoT devices and update predictions dynamically.
5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on risk assessments, tailored healthcare recommendations will be provided to users.
